    <div><h2>Foods For A Tuberculosis Patient</h2>
      <p>There is no special food that is required by a person with TB. A person with TB does not need special food,
        although they they should try and have a balanced diet. <br><br>
  
        Some people with TB believe that more expensive foods are better than less expensive ones. This is not true. For
        example, it is not true that expensive varieties of rice are better than cheaper ones.
        <br>
        There are also no foods that can cure TB. Some people say that foods such as vinegar can cure TB but this is not
        correct. It is only TB drugs that can cure TB.
        <br>
        It is often better that a person with TB has the same diet as normal but possibly with some changes being made to
        increase their intake of food. People with TB often have a poor appetite initially, but having more frequent food
        intake can be helpful.
        <br>
        Within a few weeks of starting TB treatment, the person’s appetite should increase and come back to normal. A
        person with TB should aim to have three meals and three snacks each day to increase the amount of food they eat.

    <h3>A healthy balanced diet for a person with TB</h3>
    <p>
      A person with TB should aim to have a healthy balanced diet. A healthy balanced diet can be achieved by having
      foods from four basic food groups. These are:

    <ul>
      <li> Cereals, millets and pulses</li>
      <li> Vegetables and fruits</li>
      <li> Milk and milk products, meat, eggs & fish</li>
      <li> Oils, fats and nuts and oils seeds.</li>
    </ul>
    A food group is a collection of foods that share similar nutritional properties. If the food eaten contains food
    from all the above food groups, then the diet is considered healthy. Not all the food groups need to be eaten at
    every meal.
    </p>
    <h3>Food & TB, essential nutrients</h3>
    <p>An essential nutrient is a nutrient that must be provided by a person’s diet. These nutrients are necessary for
      the body to function properly. The six essential nutrients include carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, minerals
      & water.

    <h3>Food & TB & Nutrition</h3>
    <p>Nutrition means looking at the nutrients that are provided by people’s diets. For a long time it has been known
      that there is a link between TB & malnutrition. If people do not have sufficient nutrition, sometimes referred to
      as under nutrition, then this makes TB worse. Under nutrition weakens the body’s ability to fight disease.

      TB also makes under nutrition worse. Most individuals with TB experience weight loss. This can be caused by
      several factors including reduced food intake due to loss of appetite.

      In India a Direct Benefit Transfer scheme provides people with TB with additional money for food.</p>



    <div class="section1">
      <div>
        <h3>Physical activity</h3>
        <p>If a person with TB is able to carry out any physical activity then this can be beneficial. Physical activity
          helps food intake to be converted into muscle mass, and it also improves the appetite.</p>

        <h3>What food should be avoided by a person with TB</h3>
        <p>A person with TB should avoid the following:
        <ul>
          <li> Alcohol in any form, as it increases the risk of drug toxicity</li>
          <li> Carbonated drinks</li>
          <li> Excess of tea and coffee, or their intake with food</li>
          <li> Tobacco and tobacco products</li>
